# Device profiles and standard builds

Made Tech uses standard builds for the devices issued to team members to facilitate support and maintenance, and enforce company standards in security. Standard builds are not used where the IMS management team and/or leadership have agreed there is a clear case for not doing so, as well as when the application or purpose of platform requires alternative or special configurations.

As part of our commitment to secure working practices, we install separate admin and user profiles on laptops. The reason this restriction is in place is to prevent the accidental downloading and installation of malicious software on company devices and to protect both Made Tech and our customers.

Team members will have access to an admin account for the purpose of upgrading system software. This account must not be logged in to directly, and should be used only for the purpose of updating installed software or installing pre-approved software.

## Business Teams

Separate admin and standard profiles must be installed on devices being used by members of business teams at Made Tech (Sales, People, Operations etc.), who do not engage in engineering and active development.

Your device will be set up with separate admin and standard profiles as standard. You will be given access to the admin profile so you can install any necessary software.

If you are a member of a business team, and using a device with split admin and standard user profiles, you should follow these guidelines:
 - You should always log into your standard user profile as default.
 - You can download approved software from the list below using your admin credentials, or any software necessary for your regular work.
 - You should use your admin credentials to install any software or OS updates on a regular basis to ensure you are always running the latest version.
 - If you are uncertain about what you are downloading and installing, please talk to the CSO or ISMS manager for support.


## Engineering and Delivery Teams

To make access admin rights you must follow the process listed below:

- Email support@systemagic.co.uk to request  a temp admin passwrod with a detailed reason for requiring access.
- Once change or work has been completed please discard the password.

This process is currently used in line with curre Cyber Essential standards as detialby IASME. It is unsder consideration to enhance and enable our MT employees to get better access. Any questions contact Operations.
