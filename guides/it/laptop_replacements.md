# Laptop replacements

The laptop renewal period is 3 years, which is based on the age of the laptop not the amount of time an individual has had it. Replacing your laptop is entirely optional, if you want to keep your current laptop that’s fine. 

- Systemagic will contact you to let you know the laptop is eligible for renewal. You’ll be offered a new machine in line with our agreed [Hardware Specifications for your role.](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/guides/it/Hardware.md)

- Systemagic will then arrange to send you a new laptop. 

- Once you've finished transferring any information from your old laptop you need to either send it back to Systemagic or arrange to drop it off with a member of the Ops Team in the London office. For either method please can you ensure: 

- That the device is clean (no stickers)
- That the charger is included
- There is a note with your name on it so that Systemagic can identify who it’s from. 

If you are posting the laptop you need to ensure it’s suitably packaged (correctly sized Cardboard box) and has plenty of internal padding to ensure a safe return.
